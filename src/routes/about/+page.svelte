<main class="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-4">
	<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">Seriously, what else do you want?</h2>

	<p class="mt-4">
		You're probably working a job or getting a degree. It's going okay. But you want more. You're
		tired of writing to-do list apps, your boss is a nice guy but you can't work for him <em
			>forever</em
		>. You want to travel, have a garden, restore old motorcycles, get a FAANG job, do interpretive
		dance, ventriloquism, anything! But being a great ventriloquist takes time. And you played too
		much League of Legends in your teens. You are starting from zero.
	</p>

	<p class="mt-4">
		Time, time, time. You have little to spare. Plus, you're okay! What you've got is <em>just</em>
		enough. Next weekend, next month, after the project is over, after I pass the class. You delay. You
		give up. Grow old, and those tomatoes never sprout, you never get to see the Taj Mahal, shake Zucc's
		hand or ride that bike into the sunset. Because you are "okay" building CRUD dashboards instead of
		working on your ideas.
		<s>Are you crazy?</s> And hey listen, I get it, life gets busy. You say:
	</p>

	<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
		<li>I don't have enough time.</li>
		<li>I'm not experienced enough.</li>
		<li>I don't have enough money.</li>
		<li>I'm afraid of failure.</li>
		<li>I don't have a good business idea.</li>
		<li>I'm too comfortable in my current job.</li>
		<li>I don't want to take on the risk.</li>
		<li>I'm waiting for the right moment.</li>
		<li>I'm not sure if I have the necessary skills.</li>
		<li>I'm concerned about the economic climate.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">What you're missing is</h3>

	<p class="mt-4">
		Stakes. Now, everyone knows that <a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl1ImG2b1k8"
			class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">discipline beats motivation</a
		>. Discipline starts with action. It's hard to sit on the couch when a starving 300kg grizzly
		bear just walked into the room.
	</p>

	<p class="mt-4">Guess what, I am the bear. Roar!</p>

	<p class="mt-4">
		I will <s>take</s> borrow your wage, pocket money, state pension, <em>until</em> you commit to your
		own ideas.
	</p>

	<p class="mt-4">
		I know. It's harsh. Sorry. Life's tough - get a helmet. This is how it's gonna work.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">I set you up with a $0 a month Stripe subscription.</h2>

	<p class="mt-4">Gimme your Github. Every day I check in on your commit graph.</p>
	<p class="mt-4">Green? Great job - you get a nice email.</p>
	<p class="mt-4">
		Not green? I've got good and bad news. Bad: You get a naughty email. Good: You now owe me <code
			>$AMOUNT_YOU_SELECTED</code
		>. Better luck next time.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">Wait what the fuuu..</h2>

	<p class="mt-4">
		You silly sausage. Can't you tell from the retro look of this website that I'm not kidding
		around? Now I don't want your hard-earned cash to go to Mr Stripe as transaction charges so your
		balance is settled at the end of the month. You can
		<b>opt out any time</b> if you want.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-4">
		Hopefully by that point you have built an independent work practice and can ditch the training
		wheels.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">It works</h2>

	<p class="mt-4">
		Look at this. This is my commit graph. You can see where I started charging myself money. Now
		Zucc still isn't returning my calls. But I am persistent. I will get there. Or die trying.
	</p>

	<p class="mt-4">And you will too. I believe in you.</p>

	<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">
		That's it. <a href="./subscribe.html" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Bet on yourself.</a>
	</h2>

	<p class="mt-4">Or don't!</p>

	<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Look at the numbers</h3>
